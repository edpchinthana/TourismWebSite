The fort is located near the coastal village of Gurunagar. Due to numerous miracles attributed to the statue of Virgin Mary in the church nearby, the fort was named as Fortress of Our Lady of Miracles of Jafanapatão (Fortaleza de Nossa Senhora dos Milagres de Jafanapatão). It was captured by the Dutch under Rijcklof van Goens in 1658 who expanded it. In 1795, it was taken over by the British, and remained under the control of a British garrison till 1948. As the only large military fort in the country, due to the presence of only government and military buildings within its ramparts, it was garrisoned by a detachment of the Ceylon Army.",

The current chief incumbent (chief priest) is Venerable Professor Kollupitiye Mahinda Sangharakkhitha Thera.<br><br>The temple has often been associated with the rise and fall of Ceylon / Sri Lanka, with the popular saying that as the Kelaniya temple rose, Sri Lanka rose and as it fell, the country and its administration fell. It has thus had a deep association with the political powers of the country.<br><br>It is also infamous for Mapitigama Buddharakkitha, the chief conspirator of the 1959 assassination of Ceylon's fourth Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike.[2] Buddharakkitha was the chief incumbent (chief priest) of the Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara from 1947 to 1959",

Galle Lighthouse stands on the fort’s southeast tip.<br><br>The Old Gate, the fortification’s original entrance, bears the insignia of the Dutch East India Company. The gate leads to the National Maritime Museum, with exhibits focusing on seafaring and marine life, including a whale skeleton and items salvaged from shipwrecks. Galle National Museum, in a 1656 building, displays southern Sri Lankan artifacts such as ritual masks and woodcarvings, and objects from the colonial era. Just outside the northern fortifications, the Galle International Stadium hosts cricket matches with Indian Ocean views.",

The plains' vegetation is grasslands interspersed with montane forest and includes many endemic woody plants.
