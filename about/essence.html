        <h1>ESSENCE</h1>
        When one hears the words ‘Sri Lanka’, they think of golden beaches, sunsets, tea, or cricket teams. Yet those who visit Sri Lanka come for the tropical sunsets but stay for the food.
        <br><br>
        Sri Lankan food is like no other. Filled with aromatic spices and vibrant colour, Sri Lankan food leaves you feeling happy, warm, and content. To any native Sri Lankan, nothing beats a hearty plate of rice and curry. So much so that most Sri Lankans insist on carrying jars of homemade curry or condiments when they travel abroad.
        <br><br>
        While spiciness is essentially a defining feature of Sri Lankan food, curry is most definitely another. Various different curries made with a multitude of different vegetables, meats, and spices are abundant in Sri Lanka. When you think of rice and curry, you immediately picture a full plate of rice, spicy meat curry, dhal curry, papadum (crispy deep fried crackers), mallum (green salad) and a deep fried red chilli for a little extra kick. Sri Lankan curry varies from the not-at-all-spicy kiri hodi and the mildly spicy dhal curry to the eye-wateringly spicy chicken curry that is everyone’s favourite. From lunu miris (spicy onion sambol) and pol sambol (coconut sambol) to maalu ambulthiyal (fish curry), the variety and variation of Sri Lankan curry and sambols is endless, and is a must for everyone who visits Sri Lanka. But wait! Rice is not the only thing you eat curry with! Sri Lankan cuisine offers a variety of uniquely Sri Lankan foods such as indi appa (string hoppers), appa (hoppers), pittu and roti that pair amazingly well with the different curries and sambols.
